# Structure-Blind Signal Recovery

Matlab reproducible experiments from the [full version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05712) of the following paper:

Dmitrii Ostrovskii, Zaid Harchaoui, Anatoli Judistky, Arkadi Nemirovski. [Structure-Blind Signal Recovery](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6063-structure-blind-signal-recovery.pdf). NIPS 2016.

We use [AdaFilter](https://github.com/ostrodmit/AdaFilter) codes for the efficient implementation of adaptive signal denoising, including them as a submodule.

# Usage

Download or clone the repository.

1. To reproduce the experiments from the main paper, add the following paths in **MATLAB**:
